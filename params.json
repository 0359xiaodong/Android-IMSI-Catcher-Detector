{"name":"Android IMSI-Catcher Detector (AIMSICD)","tagline":"Detect and avoid IMSI-Catcher attacks!","body":"## Android IMSI-Catcher Detector (AIMSICD)\r\n\r\nAndroid-based project to detect and (hopefully one day) avoid fake base stations (IMSI-Catchers) in GSM/UMTS Networks. Sounds cool and security is important to you? Feel free to contribute! ;-)\r\n\r\n**German Article about our Project**: [IMSI-Catcher Erkennung für Android – AIMSICD](http://www.kuketz-blog.de/imsi-catcher-erkennung-fuer-android-aimsicd/).\r\n\r\n* Discussion and constructive criticism: [Official Development Thread on XDA](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1422969).\r\n* Before submitting a commit, please carefully read our [Styleguide](https://github.com/SecUpwN/Android-IMSI-Catcher-Detector/blob/master/STYLEGUIDE.md).\r\n* Storage for source code we should add: [MERGESOURCE](https://github.com/SecUpwN/Android-IMSI-Catcher-Detector/tree/master/MERGESOURCE), **carefully** follow this [README](https://github.com/SecUpwN/Android-IMSI-Catcher-Detector/blob/master/MERGESOURCE/SOURCES_README).\r\n* Developers will be [rewarded](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?p=46957078). You know of a cool crowdfunding service? [Recommend it to us](https://github.com/SecUpwN/Android-IMSI-Catcher-Detector/issues/1).\r\n* Not a developer? You can help too! Get the [GSMmap-APP](https://opensource.srlabs.de/projects/mobile-network-assessment-tools/wiki/GSMmap-apk) and submit collected data to the [GSM Security Map](https://www.gsmmap.org/) to enlarge its database for comparison of mobile network protection capabilities!\r\n* Want to know what's boiling under the hood? You're welcome to bookmark our [Changelog](https://github.com/SecUpwN/Android-IMSI-Catcher-Detector/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).\r\n\r\n# Introduction\r\n\r\n[![DEF CON 18: Practical Cellphone Spying](http://img.youtube.com/vi/fQSu9cBaojc/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQSu9cBaojc)\r\n\r\nYouTube: DEF CON 18 - Practical Cellphone Spying with Kristin Paget\r\n\r\nUnfortunately it seems that IMSI-Catchers have been exponentially popular lately, with an explosion of various \"bastards\" with governments and criminals all the same, using it. Anyone can now buy an IMSI-Catcher (or build a cheap one on his own). In addition they can all crack the A5.1-3 encryption on the fly! This is why the original author named \"E:V:A\" started this project. Let's detect and protect against these threats! Never think that you've got \"nothing to hide\". You'll very likely regret it one day.\r\n\r\n* Get scared on YouTube: [How easy it is to clone a phone + call when connected to a femtocell](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ydo19YOzpzU).\r\n* Also, check out this talk by Karsten Nohl and Luca Melette on [28c3: Defending mobile phones](http://youtu.be/YWdHSJsEOck).\r\n\r\n![IMSI-Catcher during the riots on Taksim Square](http://i43.tinypic.com/2i9i0kk.jpg)\r\n\r\n# Development Roadmap\r\n\r\n##### Make an empty \"shell\" App that:\r\n\r\n* a. collects relevant RF related variables using public API calls. (LAC etc)\r\n* b. puts them in an SQLite database\r\n* c. catches hidden SMS's\r\n* d. catches hidden App installations\r\n\r\n##### Make another empty \"shell\" App (or module) that:\r\n\r\n* e. opens a device **local** terminal root shell\r\n* f. uses (e.) to connect to the modem AT-Command Processor ATCoP via shared memory interface SHM\r\n* g. displays the results from sent AT commands\r\n* NOTE: This is **crucial** to our project. Please help E:V:A develop a [Native AT Command Injector](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1708598)!\r\n\r\n##### [Possibly] Make another App that:\r\n\r\n* h. use the OTG (USB-host-mode) interface to use FTDI serial cable to interface with another OsmocomBB compatible phone (using Android host as a GUI host)\r\n* i. uses the \"[CatcherCatcher](https://opensource.srlabs.de/projects/mobile-network-assessment-tools/wiki/CatcherCatcher)\" detector SW on the 2nd phone\r\n* j. can inject fake 2G GSM location data\r\n* k. find out how to access L0-L2 data using the ATCoP connection\r\n* l. use a statistical algorithm (and smart thinking) on the DB data to detect rogue IMSI catchers\r\n* m. combine all of the above (steps h to l) into a BETA App for testing, add more languages\r\n* n. improve BETA app by adding (many more) things like IMSI-Catcher counter measures\r\n\r\n##### Further ideas (none of them for sure yet):\r\n\r\n* Add option to make app device administrator\r\n* Add switch to utilize ROOT for digging deeper\r\n* Usage of the [XPosed Framework](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1574401)\r\n\r\n# Summary (please read carefully!)\r\n\r\n### This project: \r\n\r\n* Detects IMSI based device location tracking\r\n* Provides counter measures against device tracking\r\n* Can provide swarm-wise-decision-based cellular service interruption\r\n* Can provide secure wifi/wimax alternative data routes through MESH-like networking\r\n* Detect and prevent remote hidden application installation\r\n* Detect and prevent remote hidden SMS-based SIM attacks\r\n* Prevent or spoof GPS data\r\n* Does NOT secure any data transmissions\r\n* Does NOT prevent already installed rogue application from full access\r\n\r\n### Other projects (NOT this one):\r\n\r\n* Provide full device encryption\r\n* Provide secure application sand-boxing\r\n* Provide secure data transmission\r\n* Provide firewalls (awesome solution: [AFWall+](https://github.com/ukanth/afwall))\r\n\r\n### License\r\n\r\nThis project is completely licensed under [GPL v3+](https://github.com/SecUpwN/Android-IMSI-Catcher-Detector/blob/master/LICENSE).\r\n\r\n### Bug tracker\r\n\r\nFound a bug? Please [create an issue here on GitHub](https://github.com/SecUpwN/Android-IMSI-Catcher-Detector/issues/new)!\r\n\r\n# Credits & Greetings\r\n\r\nOur project would not have been possible without [these awesome people](https://github.com/SecUpwN/Android-IMSI-Catcher-Detector/blob/master/CREDITS). HUGE THANKS! ;-)\r\n\r\nThis list will be updated as our project evolves and shall be included within the final app.\r\n\r\n### Websites about security worth checking out:\r\n\r\n* [Smartphone Attack Vector](http://smartphone-attack-vector.de/) - Smartphone flaws and countermeasures\r\n* [Kuketz IT-Security Blog](http://www.kuketz-blog.de/) - Great Security Reviews (written in German)\r\n* [PRISM Break](https://prism-break.org/) - Alternatives to opt out of global data surveillance\r\n* [The Guardian Project](https://guardianproject.info/) - Secure Open Source Mobile Apps\r\n* [Security Research Labs](https://srlabs.de/) - Stunning Security Revelations made in Berlin\r\n* [The Surveillance Self-Defense Project](https://ssd.eff.org/) - Defend against the threat of surveillance\r\n* [Electronic Frontier Foundation](https://www.eff.org/) - nonprofit organization defending civil liberties in the digital world\r\n* [TextSecure](https://github.com/WhisperSystems/TextSecure) - Secure text messaging application for Android (replace WhatsApp)\r\n* [RedPhone](https://github.com/WhisperSystems/RedPhone) - encrypted voice calls for Android\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
